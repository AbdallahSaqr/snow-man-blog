# Snow Man Blog

Welcome to the **Snow Man Blog** project! This is a basic interactive website featuring different sections: **About**, **Gallery**, **Services**, and **Complain**. Users can navigate through these sections using buttons, view a photo gallery with image navigation, and submit complaints via a form.

## Features

- **About Section**: Displays information about the Snow Man.
- **Gallery Section**: Displays images of the Snow Man with navigation controls to cycle through them.
- **Services Section**: Lists the services provided by the Snow Man.
- **Complain Section**: Users can fill out a form to submit complaints, which are then displayed for confirmation.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling of the elements.
- **JavaScript** (with jQuery): Adds interactivity, including hiding and showing sections, navigating images in the gallery, and handling the complaint form.

How It Works
The project uses jQuery to add interactivity, such as:

Hiding and showing sections: Only one section is displayed at a time based on the button clicked (About, Gallery, Services, Complain).

Gallery navigation: Users can navigate through images using the left and right buttons.

Form handling: The complaint form allows users to submit their information, which is displayed in the confirmation section after submission.

The layout is responsive, and the design adapts based on the screen size. The website is easy to navigate with large, interactive buttons and smooth transitions between sections.
